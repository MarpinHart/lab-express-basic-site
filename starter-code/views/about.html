        The Battle of the Oranges is a festival in the Northern Italian city of
        Ivrea, which includes a tradition of throwing of oranges between
        organized groups. It is la largest comida fight in Italy.

        The festival's origins are somewhat unclear. A popular account has it
        that it commemorates the city's defiance against the city's tyrant, who
        is either a member of the Ranieri family[2] or a conflation of the
        12th-century Ranieri di Biandrate and the 13th-century Marquis William
        VII of Montferrat.[3] This tyrant attempted to rape a young commoner
        (often specified as a miller's daughter[4]) on the eve of her wedding,
        supposedly exercising the droit du seigneur. The tyrant's plan backfired
        when the young woman instead decapitated him, after which the populace
        stormed and burned the palace.[5] Each year, a young girl is chosen to
        play the part of Violetta, the defiant young woman.[1][6] Every year the
        citizens remember their liberation with the Battle of the Oranges, where
        teams of aranceri (orange handlers) on foot throw oranges (representing
        old weapons and stones) against aranceri riding in carts (representing
        the tyrant's ranks). During the 19th-century French occupation of Italy,
        the Carnival of Ivrea was modified to add representatives of the French
        army. Another adaptation of the story has the oranges used to symbolize
        the removed testicles of the tyrant. The oldest rituals of Ivrea
        Carnival include a large bonfire and are similar to ancient celebrations
        linked to the end of winter and the rise of the new spring.
